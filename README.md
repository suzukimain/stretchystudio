# 🧬 Stretchy Studio

**Stretchy Studio** is a high-performance 2D animation tool designed for illustrators and animators. It streamlines the workflow from static 2D artwork (PSD/PNG) to fully realized, mesh-deformable animations and spritesheets.

Unlike traditional bone-based systems, Stretchy Studio focuses on a **timeline-first, direct-deformation workflow** reminiscent of After Effects, providing a lower learning curve while maintaining professional-grade flexibility.

## ✨ Key Features

### 📂 Intelligent Import
- **PSD Layer Extraction**: Full support for multi-layer PSD files with layer names, order, and opacity preserved.
- **Character Format Detection**: Intelligent recognition of 23+ character part tags (e.g., *eyebrow_L*, *topwear*, *footwear*). Automatically organizes layers into a structured **Head** (with **Eyes** subgroup), **Body** (with **Upper/Lowerbody**), and **Extras** hierarchy while preserving the original PSD draw order.
- **Mesh-on-Demand**: Start with lightweight textures; opt-in to low-poly mesh generation for advanced deformation when needed.

### 📐 Precision Rigging
- **Hierarchical Transforms**: Nested group structures with parent-child transform inheritance.
- **Intuitive Gizmos**: World-space move and rotate handles for direct canvas manipulation.
- **Pivot Calibration**: Accurate pivot placement for natural rotations and scaling.
- **Alpha-Based Selection**: Pixel-perfect selection that works instantly on both textured quads and complex meshes.

### 🎬 Professional Timeline
- **AE-Style Workflow**: Familiar keyframing system for transforms (X, Y, Rotation, Scale, Skew) and Mesh Vertices.
- **Multi-Clip Management**: Create multiple animation sequences (e.g., *Idle*, *Walk*, *Attack*) within a single project.
- **Direct Vertex Keyframing**: "Warp" your illustrations by animating individual mesh vertices for organic motion.
- **Smooth Interpolation**: High-performance rendering loop with real-time pose blending.

### ⚡ Optimized Engine
- **WebGL2 Renderer**: Custom rendering pipeline using VAOs, batching, and hierarchical matrix math for 60 FPS performance.
- **Pose Separation**: Playback state is decoupled from the project model, ensuring a non-destructive animation workflow.
- **Low Memory Footprint**: Efficient texture and vertex buffer management.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v18+)
- [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/) (Recommended) or `npm`

### Setup

1. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pnpm install
   ```

2. **Run the development server**:
   ```bash
   pnpm dev
   ```

3. **Open the browser**:
   Navigate to `http://localhost:5173`.

## 🎨 Workflow Example

1. **Import**: Drag a PSD character into the viewport.
2. **Organize**: Use the Groups tab to parent arms to the torso.
3. **Rig**: Select a part, click "Generate Mesh", and move the pivot to the joint.
4. **Animate**: Switch to "Animation" mode, create a new clip, and start dropping keyframes.
5. **Warp**: Use the Brush tool to deform the mesh for hair or cloth motion.
6. **Export**: (Coming Soon) Export as a packed spritesheet or PNG sequence.
